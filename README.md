html, css and JavaScript model of the known universe.

Ideally I would like to implement this thing in native javascript, straight-up css, and simple HTML.

We'll see how that goes.

features wish list:
* 2d animation of the planets in rotation around the sun
* something for the Ort Cloud
* comets
* meteors
* information about heavenly bodies in tooltips or similar
* 3d animation of the planets in rotation around the sun
* nasa space vehicles (size, photos, range, history, etc.)
* more to come...
